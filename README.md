# color_detection

Color  detection  is  the  process  of detecting  name  of  the color.  It is easy  task for human  to detect  the color  and choose  one. But computer  cannot  detect  the  color  easily.  This  is tough  task  for  computer  to  detect the  color  easily. So that's   why  I chose this project. Many of  the project  and  research  papers  are  written  on  this problem.  But  we  use  different  techniques  for  this project. I have used Pandas  and  openCV (Open  Source  Computer  Vision Library) libraries  used  in python  languages.
